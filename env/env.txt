I will be using Notepad++ as my text editor for this course. I am familiar with this text editor and have used it for many other CSE courses before. I have also tried Vim editor and I realize that once you get past how difficult it is to use, it's a great editor. But for this course I believe Notepad++ will suffice. It's very easy to use in comparison to vim. I am using Google Chrome as my browser because that is my favorite browser.
