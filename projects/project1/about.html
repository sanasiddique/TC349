	I am Sana Siddique. I am a senior in Computer Engineering at Michigan State University. I enjoy programming a lot and hope to become a software developer on completion of my degree. I like it because it challenges me everyday. 
	I am currently a student programmer at MATRIX: The Center for the Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences has been very educative. I have learned web programming languages like HTML, PHP and javascript working on various projects. Besides these I have more than 4 years of experience with C++ and Python. 
	I also enjoy solving problem and have good analytical skills. Learning about new softwares and new technology helps me keep myself updated on the industry. I am also the socila chair of my residence hall so I plan and organize events for my hall.
