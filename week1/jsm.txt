The website josonsantamaria.com is basically a blog. I like the timeline appearance of the blog as it seems familiar. It looks simple yet elegant at the same time. The choice of colors for the website is good. I also like that video's have been embedded directly on the website. 

Looking at the page source of the website one can tell that the simple styling was included within the html and not in a separate CSS document.
Also since there are a large number of articles posted on the website it is probably backed by a database system which maintains these articles' information and their paths.
