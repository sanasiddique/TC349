    <h2 class="basic">About Me:</h2>
	<p1>
	I am Sana Siddique. I am a senior in Computer Engineering at Michigan State University. I enjoy programming a lot and hope to become a software developer on completion of my degree. I like it because it challenges me everyday. 
	I am currently a student programmer at MATRIX: The Center for the Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences has been very educative. I have learned web programming languages like HTML, PHP and javascript working on various projects. Besides these I have more than 4 years of experience with C++ and Python. 
	I also enjoy solving problem and have good analytical skills. Learning about new softwares and new technology helps me keep myself updated on the industry. I am also the socila chair of my residence hall so I plan and organize events for my hall.

	<h2 class="basic">Website Critique:</h2>
	<p2>
	This website is basically about a company that makes apps for Macs, iphones and ipads and through this website you can easily download them. I like this website's user interface. I also like that instead of writing the instructions a demo has been embedded directly. 
	</p2></br>

	A look at the source shows that it has separate css and javascript files linked in to the html. The selection of colors is also great and makes it easy to find information. It also allows users to purchase apps safely on the website. Overall: excellent user interface.
