This is a youtube-like video sharing website. the home page is quite impressive and ives a lot of information about what can be done after registering with the website. There are links to a good number of tutorials on how to upload/share/discover videos. It also states the reason why its better than any other video sharing website- because there are no advertisements before, during or afte videos.
The website has an interesting background. I like the combination of colors, they work well together. Creating an account on the website is pretty straightforward. 
A tile pattern is used in design, similar to what we did in week 6. There's also another version available for purchase for professinal video makers. The home page is like a brochure and tells the user everything they need to know about using the website.
