The home page of the website has a all the information about it and uses colors that work well together. It also uses a lot of different uncommon fonts. I can tell from the source that these fonts are from typekit like in the lab this week. All elements in the website have different kinds of fonts. For example all h2 tags are font-family: 'rooney-web-n7', 'rooney-web', Georgia, 'Times New Roman'. The lagre number of fonts works for the website because its being followed repeatedly throughout the same page. If it wasn't repetitive it would just be too many different fonts on the same page. 
Browsing the website is pretty simple. font/image sizes are good and readable.The website has a white background which makes the usage of all the different colors acceptable.
I like the combination of colors, they work well together.
