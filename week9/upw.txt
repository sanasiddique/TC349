This is another online shopping website that uses a lot of different features. This website uses jquery library of javascript for browsing through the website similar to what we did in the lab this week. It also uses a tile pattern css using using padding, border and margin. When you hover the arrow over an item it moves without refreshing the entire page and this feature is implemented through jquery. I think the color combination makes the website easier to browse and very user friendly. 
What makes this website different from other online shopping websites is that it also features various articles and different categories of designs on the same page along the shirts. This makes the website a little confusing to browse. It should have had a different format and different location for things like signing up using email address and articles about the designers.
